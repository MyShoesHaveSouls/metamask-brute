## For educational purposes only
A program random generate (12, 18, 24) words metamask mnemonic phrase.

## How it works
If needed, you can securely generate a random seed phrase consisting of 12, 24, or any other desired number of words. You have the option to verify the accuracy of the seed phrase by cross-referencing it with a wordlist. In case any word does not match the predefined list, you'll receive a notification. Additionally, you can check all your individual addresses without a wallet, allowing you to calculate the addresses and private keys manually, which can be helpful in accessing funds if you lose your wallet and cannot recover it.

Another precautionary measure is to create a new wallet and promptly transfer your coins to the newly generated coin address. Subsequently, you can enter the seed phrase into the wallet to recover access to your funds. This approach proves beneficial, especially in the unfortunate event of a compromised or hacked wallet. For added security, you also have the option to generate a truly random seed phrase using your own source of entropy.
 By performing the actions described above, we can get the following results
